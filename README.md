# Making-Alice-Small

Things to do:

Encoding:

open the file

read it through and attach "\n" to the end of each line

count the character types in each line and save to array

go through that array and put each element in an array with a special class

construct aHuffmanTree

set up a SortedMap<Character(char represenation of the chars), String (binary digits of pathway to each node)>

set up another SortedMap<String, Character> this time

read in the original file again using the map to set up a binary String version of the coded text

translate this into an array of bytes

save this to a file with the name original.huf

the array of character/count should also be saved as original.cod

output <filename>.huf : <compression ratio>% compression

Decoding:

open the .cod file and recreate array of character/count

pass to the HuffmanTree class constructor

this will reconstruct the original tree with its maps

the .huf file will then be read into an array of bytes

to do this, go through each bit to find the leaf nodes, 

when \n is encountered the String should be written back out to a file with the same name as the original file

this file should be replaced with "x.txt"
